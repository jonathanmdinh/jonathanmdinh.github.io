          <h1>Jonathan Dinh</h1>
          <h2>Student at Queens College</h2>

          <p>I am a fourth-year college student pursuing my Computer Science degree at Queens College.
            By pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I plan on being a part of the enormous community of programmers, developing new innovations 
            for the rapidly-growing industry of technology. As a college student, I hope to build new connections with others and 
            learn more about a future career in software development.</p>
          <p>While I am studying for my college degree, I am also progressing myself as a 200 and 400 meter sprinter and a 400 meter hurdler on 
            the Queens College Track and Field team. Additionally, I am heavily inspired by my love for music, as I work on my talents as a 
            music producer, pianist, and dancer. </p>
