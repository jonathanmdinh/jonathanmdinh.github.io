## Purpose

QCfirst is a prototype for a college course enrollment website that allows students and teachers to access a variety of features:

### Student Features

- Search for Courses
- Enroll in Courses
- Drop Enrolled Courses
- Pay for Tuition
- Ability to look at Schedule

### Professor Features

- Ability to Create a Course
- Ability to look at Teaching Schedule

## Home Page

The homepage is a welcome page that allows users to access the login or sign up pages, access the course enrollment page, or access the advising offices page that Queens College offers.

### Homepage Desktop Design

### Homepage Moble Design

## Log In

The login page allows users to access a form that logs them into to their accounts to access student or teacher-specific pages such as the course enrollment page, the account settings page, or the create a class page. The sign up page can also be accessed from this page by clicking "sign up" at the top-left of the page.

### Login Desktop Design

- The login and sign up buttons remained in the same place as the homepage, rather than on top of the border of the form container. This decision was made to keep the positioning of the buttons throughout the pages consistent, rather than have them change from one page to the next.

### Login Tablet Design

### Login Mobile Design

- The final design of the mobile login page includes the Queens College logo at the top left. The initial visual design took into account, the lack of space on the screen, which  led to the decision of removing the logo. However, after completing the code for this design, it was concluded that there was enough space for the logo to remain, ultimately improving the design.

## Sign Up

The sign up page allows users to access a form that creates a new account. The login page can also be accessed from this page by clicked "login" at the top-left of the page.

### Sign Up Desktop Design

- The login and sign up buttons remained in the same place as the homepage, rather than on top of the border of the form container. This decision was made to keep the positioning of the buttons throughout the pages consistent, rather than have them change from one page to the next.

### Sign Up Tablet Design

### Sign Up Mobile Design

- Similarly to the mobile design for the login page, the Queens College logo was kept in the sign up mobile design, straying from the initial visual designs. 

## Create A Class

The create a class page allows teachers to access a form that create a new class.
